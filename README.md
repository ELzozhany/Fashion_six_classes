Overview
The "Fashion Six Classes" dataset is a comprehensive collection of images representing six distinct categories of fashion items. This dataset is designed to facilitate the development and testing of machine learning models for fashion classification tasks. Each category contains over 1000  images, making it a robust resource for various computer vision applications.

Classes
The dataset is divided into the following six classes:

1. Accessories
   - This class includes a variety of fashion accessories such as belts, hats, glasses, watches, and bags. Each image 
      showcases an accessory in different styles and settings.

2. Formal
   - The Formal class features images of formal clothing items, including suits, blazers, dress shirts, and ties. These 
      images capture the elegance and sophistication of formal wear.

3. Hoodie
